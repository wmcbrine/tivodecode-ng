tivodecode (c) 2006-2007, Jeremy Drake
Version 0.3pre5
See COPYING for license terms.

This project now uses autoconf for its build system.  See the INSTALL file for
generic autoconf instructions, or just run:
./configure
make
make install

To build on Windows, a Visual C++ Express 2005 solution file is included.  If
you have a working installation of this compiler, building should be as simple
as opening this solution file and building the tivodecode project.

If you are using the Windows binary download, you may need the Visual Studio
2005 Redisributables from Microsoft, if you do not already have MSVCR80.DLL
installed from some other software.

You now have the option to, rather than specifying the MAK on the command line
every time, to specify it in a config file in your home directory.  Simply put
your MAK in a file called ~/.tivodecode_mak and it will be automatically used
if a MAK is not specified on the command line.  On Windows, the file should be
in your %USERPROFILE% directory, or in c:\ if there is no %USERPROFILE% set.

The parameters (from --help) are documented below.


Usage: ./tivodecode [--help] [--verbose|-v] [--no-verify|-n] {--mak|-m} mak [{--out|-o} outfile] <tivofile>

  --mak, -m          media access key (required)
  --out, -o          output file (default stdout)
  --verbose, -v      verbose (add more v's for more verbosity)
  --no-verify, -n    do not verify MAK while decoding
  --no-video, -x     don't decode video, exit after metadata
  --version, -V      print the version information and exit
  --help, -h         print this help and exit

The file names specified for the output file or the tivo file may be -, which
means stdout or stdin respectively
