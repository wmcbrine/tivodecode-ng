tivodecode-ng version 0.2
Copyright 2006-2018, Jeremy Drake et al.
See COPYING for license terms.

This project now uses autoconf for its build system.  See the INSTALL file for
generic autoconf instructions, or just run:
./configure
make
make install

You now have the option to, rather than specifying the MAK on the command line
every time, to specify it in a config file in your home directory.  Simply put
your MAK in a file called ~/.tivodecode_mak and it will be automatically used
if a MAK is not specified on the command line.  On Windows, the file should be
in your %USERPROFILE% directory, or in c:\ if there is no %USERPROFILE% set.

The parameters (from --help) are documented below.


Usage: ./tivodecode [--help] [--verbose|-v] [--no-verify|-n] {--mak|-m} mak [{--out|-o} outfile] <tivofile>

  --mak, -m          media access key (required)
  --out, -o          output file (default stdout)
  --verbose, -v      verbose (add more v's for more verbosity)
  --no-verify, -n    do not verify MAK while decoding
  --dump-metadata,-D dump metadata from TiVo file to xml files (development)
  --no-video, -x     don't decode video, exit after metadata
  --version, -V      print the version information and exit
  --help, -h         print this help and exit

The file names specified for the output file or the tivo file may be -, which
means stdout or stdin respectively
